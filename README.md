# Web Dev 30
A repository for my Web Dev 30 project. I took a PSD file and created a website out of it each day for 30 consecutive days. 

Each project folder contains all the original PSD files, as well as the sliced version of them alongside the HTML/CSS/JS for every website. Bootstrap was my framework of choice for Web Dev 30.
